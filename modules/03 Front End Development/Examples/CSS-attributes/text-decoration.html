    <h3> the attribute is for adding and design underline and overline in different kinds and shapes</h3>
    <p class="under">This text has a line underneath it.</p>
    <p class="over">This text has a line over it.</p>
    <p class="line">This text has a line going through it.</p>
    <p>This <a class="plain" href="#">link will not be underlined</a>,
        as links generally are by default. Be careful when removing
        the text decoration on anchors since users often depend on
        the underline to denote hyperlinks.</p>
    <p class="underover">This text has lines above <em>and</em> below it.</p>
    <p class="blink">This text might blink for you,
        depending on the browser you use.</p>
